# odin-recipes

This is my homework for the odin project

This project is a simple website only using HTML, maybe later I will add CSS, the idea 
is building a website containing several food recipes.

By finishing this project i will review the basics of HTML : 

1. Paragraphs
2. Lists
3. Images
4. Links
5. Headings

# CSS part 

I recently added a css file to the project, to play with some styling.
